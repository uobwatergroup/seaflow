# SEAFLOW (SEAsonal FLOW forecasts toolbox)

SEAFLOW is designed to generate and assess the skill of <b>seasonal flow forecasts</b> using the <b>Tank model</b>. It is connected to <b>SEAFORM (SEAsonal weather FORcasts Management toolbox)</b> which provides seasonal weather forecasts required for hydrological modelling (Precipitation, Temperature, PET). This toolbox was developed as part of a study <b>published by Lee et al. (2024, https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.8134).
